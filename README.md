### Udacity Intro to Programming for Data Science Project using Bikeshare Data

### Description: Using a previous python project that was completed in order to perform analysis on BikeShare data provided from three popular cities, I am practicing revision control using Git and Github. This script has several functions. The first one prompts the user to input which city of data they want to look into and whether they want to filter the data set to a specific month or day of the week. Once the input is gathered without errors, the script will load the data from the provided csv files and allow the user to view 5 rows of raw input at a time. The next few functions will provide a series of statistics related to frequent times to travel, most popular stations and trips, trip durations, user types, genders, and common birth years. 

### Files used: bikeshare.py, washington.csv, new_york_city.csv, chicago.csv
